# UNet-TGS-Salt-Identification
## Description
To implement image segmentation on Kaggle 2018 TGS Salt Identification Challenge [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tgs-salt-identification-challenge), a pytorch version of UNet [[2]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28) was built only for practicing. Since the training image size is 128, the model has fewer parameters than those in the original UNet model.
